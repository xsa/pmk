This package contain some files that are designed to permit their use in
other projects :

- String hash-coding : hash.c, hash.h

- Dynamic string arrays : dynarray.c dynarray.h

- Path manipulation tools : pathtools.c pathtools.h


These files are under BSD license and are almost ready to use.
Some issues exists due to portability as it uses ISO99 booleans and
string functions like strlcpy and strlcat.
You are free to use some components of this package to assume compatibility
on all the system targets until you respect the BSD license.

NOTE : Some functions maybe missing as i have not the use in this present
package but i can add them on request (yes you can also send patches ;).
