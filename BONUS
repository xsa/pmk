This package contains some files that are designed to permit their use in
other projects:

- String hash-coding : hash.c, hash.h

- Dynamic string arrays : dynarray.c dynarray.h

- Path manipulation tools : pathtools.c pathtools.h


These files are released under the BSD license and are almost ready to 
be used.
Some issues do exist due to portability as this package uses ISO99 booleans and
string functions like strlcpy and strlcat.
You are free to use some components of this package to assume compatibility
on all the system targets as long as you do respect the BSD license.

NOTE : Some functions are maybe missing as we do not have the use in this 
current package but we could add them on request (yes, you can also send
patches ;) ).
