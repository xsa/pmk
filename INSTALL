INSTALL
-------

To build and install pmk on your system :

Easy method :

For a global use (with root privileges):
make clean cfgrm
make
make install

In user mode (without root privileges):
make clean cfgum
make
make install


Advanced method :
The pmkcfg.sh script has the following options :
-u sets user mode as on
-p permits to override the default prefix used for BASE.

The default prefixes are :
- global mode : /usr/local or $PREFIX if it is set in env
- user mode : $HOME

Example:
If you want a global use with /opt as prefix you will use the following :
sh pmkcfg.sh -p /opt
