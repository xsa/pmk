Quick install
-------------

There are two basic ways of using pmk. The first one is the common
installation that needs root privileges and that allows all users to
access pmk. The second one is the "user mode" that installs binaries in
$HOME/bin/ and data in $HOME/.pmk/ of the user doing the installation.

There are two targets to configure pmk before building it:

 Configuring with root mode:

  sh pmkcfg.sh

 Else in user mode:

  sh pmkcfg.sh -u

 After configuring you can build the package with:

  make

 And finish by installing it with:

  make install


For each new release of pmk we _highly_ recommend you to run pmksetup
before any use of the new pmk binary.


Installing PMK using previously installed binaries
--------------------------------------------------

The package also contains a pmkfile that can be used as an alternative
to the bootstrap script.

For a standard install, see the following steps:
  pmk
  make
  make install

As stated above don't forget to run pmksetup after install.


More about pmkcfg.sh
--------------------

The script has the following options:

  -p permits to override the default prefix used for BASE
  -u sets user mode as on
  -U provide an alternative user for privilege separation (default is nobody)

The default prefixes are:

  - global mode : /usr/local or $PREFIX if it is set in env
  - user mode : $HOME

Example:

If you want a global use with /opt as prefix you will use the following:
  sh pmkcfg.sh -p /opt


More about the pmkfile
----------------------

The sw_usermode switch is available to set user mode as on.

To use it do the following:
  pmk -e sw_usermode

To specify an alternate privsep user you need to set PRIVSEP_USER to the
desired user. See the following example that sets the user to '_pmk':

  pmk PRIVSEP_USER="_pmk"
