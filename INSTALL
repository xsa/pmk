The script has the following options:

  -u sets user mode as on
  -p permits to override the default prefix used for BASE.

The default prefixes are:

  - global mode : /usr/local or $PREFIX if it is set in env
  - user mode : $HOME

Example:

If you want a global use with /opt as prefix you will use the following:
  sh pmkcfg.sh -p /opt
