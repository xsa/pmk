Installing PMK
--------------

To build and install pmk on your system use one of the two following
methods:

1) The pmkcfg.sh configuration script:
  sh pmkcfg.sh
  make
  make install

2) Using previously installed pmk binary:
  pmk
  make
  make install


More about pmkcfg.sh
--------------------

The script has the following options:

  -p permits to override the default prefix used for BASE
  -u sets user mode as on
  -U provide an alternative user for privilege separation (default is nobody)

The default prefixes are:

  - global mode : /usr/local or $PREFIX if it is set in env
  - user mode : $HOME

Example:

If you want a global use with /opt as prefix you will use the following:
  sh pmkcfg.sh -p /opt

----------------------

The sw_usermode switch is available to set user mode as on.

To use it do the following:
  pmk -e sw_usermode

To specify an alternate privsep user you need to set PRIVSEP_USER to the
desired user. See the following example that sets the user to '_pmk':

  pmk PRIVSEP_USER="_pmk"
