CYGWIN :
  - cygwin seems to not handle perfectly its binaries, a 'which gcc' give
    the path to gcc but when you're looking for it directly with dir
    functions you can't get it because its real name is gcc.exe ...
    So we decided to stop cygwin support until they learn how to make
    their system working transparently (yes, between the lines you can
    read cygwin sucks).

HP-UX :
 - S_BLKSIZE doesn't exist.
 - install is not bsd compatible.

Debian/KFreeBSD :
  - this system could have the same problem than Debian/KNetBSD.


Debian/KNetBSD :
  - the uname utility is returning the 'NetBSD' string when asking for
    the operating system name. As this behavior is resulting from the
    fact that Linux distributions return the kernel name instead of the
    system name we are not able to differenciate between it from a real
    NetBSD system. That said, we do not support this system until we
    known how to deal with it.


Tru64 :
 - int64_t doesn't exist.

SunOS:
 - S_BLKSIZE doesn't exist.
