HP systems (tru64, hpux) :
  - default make does not support '+=' operator (eg: CFLAGS+=-DBLAH does
    not work). Use of GNU/make is recommended to build the package.

CYGWIN :
  - cygwin seems to not handle perfectly its binaries, a 'which gcc' give
    the path to gcc but when you're looking for it directly with dir
    functions you can't get it because its real name is gcc.exe ...
    So we decided to stop cygwin support until they learn how to make
    their system working transparently (yes, between the lines you can
    read cygwin sucks).
