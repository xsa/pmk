.Dt PMK.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pmk.conf
.Nd premake configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm pmk.conf
contains a series of assignements that are used by
.Xr pmk 1
and created by
.Xr pmksetup 8 .

.Sh DATA TYPES
Theses are common types used by pmk, see
.Xr pmkfile.5
for a complete description.

.Sh OPERATORS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm =
This operator makes the value dynamic, which means that it will
be (re)assigned everytime you run
.Xr pmksetup 8 .
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset -indent
BIN_CC = "/usr/bin/cc"
.Ed
.It Cm :
This operator makes the value static, which means that if you want
to regenerate the
.Nm pmk.conf ,
the value will be kept and not assigned dynamically by
.Xr pmksetup 8 .
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset -indent
BIN_INSTALL:"/usr/local/bin/install"
.Ed
.El
.Pp

.Sh FAMILY CLASSES
Assignements can be classed in different families.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm BIN_*
This class is used for binary paths.
.It Cm HW_*
Hardware related data like for example byte order.
.It Cm PATH_*
Specific paths family.
.It Cm OS_*
System specific data.
.It Cm misc
Some other data (such as PREFIX) cannot fit into previous families.
.El

.Sh EXAMPLES
A typical pmk.conf will look something like this:
.Bd -literal -offset -indent
