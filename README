The pmk project tries to provide an alternative to GNU configure.

There are two basic ways of using pmk. The first one is the common
installation that needs root privileges and that allows all users to
access pmk. The second one is the "user mode" that installs binaries in
$HOME/bin/ and data in $HOME/.pmk/ of the user doing the installation.

1) Installation Steps

- There are two targets to configure pmk before building it.

 Configuring with root mode:

  make cfgrm

 Else in user mode:

  make cfgum

 After configuring you can build the package with:

  make

 And finish by installing it with:

  make install


2) Testing

- Now if you feel like testing the whole suite, follow these steps:

  make clean cfgum
  make install
  make test
  make deinstall
  make clean

You can send us feedback to the following email :

  pmk-users@lists.sourceforge.net

Or if you have a sourceforge account on this forum :

  http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=258652

For more experienced users it is possible to directly use the pmkcfg.sh
script, see INSTALL for further information.

3) Supported Platforms

- Any POSIX compliant plaftorm should be supported. Actually we try to test
  our suite on the most different platforms we can.
  A summary of these tests can be found in the STATUS file. Be sure to also 
  read the BUGS file.
