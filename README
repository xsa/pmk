The pmk project tries to provide an alternative to GNU configure.

There are two basic ways of using pmk. The first one is the common
installation that needs root privileges and that allows all users to
acces pmk. The second one is the "user mode" that installs binaries in
$HOME/bin/ and data in $HOME/.pmk/ of the user doing the installation.

There are two targets to configure pmk before building it.

Configuring with root mode :

  make cfgrm

Else in user mode :

  make cfgum

After configuring you can build the package with :

  make

And finish by installing with :

  make install

Testing :

  make clean
  make test

You can send us feedback to the following email :

  pmk-users@lists.sourceforge.net

Or if you have a sourceforge account on this forum :

  http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=258652

For more experienced users it is possible to directly use the pmkcfg.sh
script, see INSTALL for further information.
