Introduction
------------

The pmk project tries to provide an alternative to GNU autoconf, GNU
libtool and pkg-config. It also provides a basic BSD install like tool
and a source scanner to help building of pmkfiles.


1) Installation Steps
---------------------

There are two basic ways of using pmk. The first one is the common
installation that needs root privileges and that allows all users to
access pmk. The second one is the "user mode" that installs binaries in
$HOME/bin/ and data in $HOME/.pmk/ of the user doing the installation.

Note: If you got pmkcfg.sh from cvs, it won't have the exec bit set.
Therefore you will have to 'chmod u+x pmkcfg.sh' before configuring pmk as
described below:

- There are two targets to configure pmk before building it.

 Configuring with root mode:

  ./pmkcfg.sh

 Else in user mode:

  ./pmkcfg.sh -u

 After configuring you can build the package with:

  make

 And finish by installing it with:

  make install


2) Testing
----------

- Now if you feel like testing the whole suite, look in the sample
  directory and check the README.sample file.

3) Supported Platforms
----------------------

- Any POSIX compliant plaftorm should be supported. Actually we try to
  test our suite on the most different platforms we can.
  A summary of these tests can be found in the STATUS file. Be sure to
  also read the BUGS file.

- It seems that Debian/KNetBSD is returning the 'NetBSD' string when
  using uname to know the operating system name. We didn't took any
  decision yet about how to deal with this. But as this system is not
  able to identify itself correctly we do not support it until further
  decision.
