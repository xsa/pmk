Introduction
------------

The pmk project tries to provide an alternative to GNU autoconf.


1) Installation Steps
---------------------

There are two basic ways of using pmk. The first one is the common
installation that needs root privileges and that allows all users to
access pmk. The second one is the "user mode" that installs binaries in
$HOME/bin/ and data in $HOME/.pmk/ of the user doing the installation.

- There are two targets to configure pmk before building it.

 Configuring with root mode:

  sh pmkcfg.sh

 Else in user mode:

  sh pmkcfg.sh -u

 After configuring you can build the package with:

  make

 And finish by installing it with:

  make install


2) Testing
----------

- Now if you feel like testing the whole suite, follow these steps:

  (make clean)
  sh pmkcfg.sh -u
  make install
  make test
  make deinstall
  make clean

You can send us feedback to the following email :

  pmk-users@lists.sourceforge.net

Or if you have a sourceforge account on this forum :

  http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=326673

For more experienced users it is possible to directly use the pmkcfg.sh
script, see INSTALL for further information.

3) Supported Platforms
----------------------

- Any POSIX compliant plaftorm should be supported. Actually we try to
  test our suite on the most different platforms we can.
  A summary of these tests can be found in the STATUS file. Be sure to
  also read the BUGS file.

- It seems that Debian/KNetBSD is returning the 'NetBSD' string when
  using uname to know the operating system name. We didn't took any
  decision yet about how to deal with this. But as this system is not
  able to identify itself correctly we do not support it until futher
  decision.
