The pmk project try to provide an alternative to gnu configure.

NOTE: OBSOLETE ?
HP systems seems to have 'make' unable to use '+=' operator.
This results in an incompatibility with our Makefile so we recommand to
use gmake instead of original make.

There is two way for using pmk. The first is the common installation
that need root privileges and that allow all users to acces pmk. The
second is the user mode that install binaries in $HOME/bin/ and data in
$HOME/.pmk/ of the user that do the install.

There is two targets to configure pmk before building.
Configuring with root mode :

  make cfgrm

Else in user mode :

  make cfgum

After configuring you can build the package with :

  make

And finish by installing with :

  make install

Testing :

  make clean
  make test_all
