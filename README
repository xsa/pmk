The pmk project try to provide an alternative to gnu configure.

There is two basic ways for using pmk. The first is the common
installation that need root privileges and that allow all users to
acces pmk. The second is the user mode that install binaries in
$HOME/bin/ and data in $HOME/.pmk/ of the user that do the install.

There is two targets to configure pmk before building.
Configuring with root mode :

  make cfgrm

Else in user mode :

  make cfgum

After configuring you can build the package with :

  make

And finish by installing with :

  make install

Testing :

  make clean
  make test_all

You can send feedback to the following email :

  pmk-users@lists.sourceforge.net

Or if you have a sourceforge account on this forum :

  http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=258652

For more experienced users it is possible to directly use the pmkcfg.sh
script, see INSTALL.
