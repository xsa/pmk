The pmk project try to provide an alternative to gnu configure.

NOTE:
HP systems seems to have 'make' unable to use '+=' operator.
This results in an incompatibility with our Makefile so we recommand to use gmake instead of original make.

Building steps :
make
make install

Testing :
edit Makefile and uncomment USER_TEST to enable local test
make clean
make
make test_all
